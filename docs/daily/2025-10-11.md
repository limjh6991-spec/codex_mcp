# 2025-10-11

## Today Summary
- Re-generated RoArm M3 USD, inspected it with `pxr.Usd` to confirm `/World/roarm_m3/link5/hand_tcp` exists, and wrote down Stage panel search tips.
- Added `scripts/manage_isaacsim_extensions.py` to persist Isaac Sim extension enable/disable/remove state and applied it to 18 Isaac/kit extensions.
- Reviewed the current RL stack (envs, configs, utilities) and drafted a phased Sim2Real plan from USD pre-training to real-robot calibration loops.

## Notable Issues & Environment Notes
- Extension TOML overrides alone do not keep certain Isaac Sim extensions disabled; need to experiment with launcher `--disable/--enableOnly` flags.
- `scripts/verify_usd_roarm_m3.py` currently fails due to CLI argument parsing; rely on temporary `pxr.Usd` checks until it is fixed.
- Isaac Sim full setup runs from `~/isaacsim-venv`; ensure this venv is activated before any tooling.

## Tomorrow
- Fix `scripts/verify_usd_roarm_m3.py` argument handling and restore hierarchy printing.
- Update launch scripts to pass explicit extension toggles and confirm persistence across restarts.
- Hook `src/envs/isaac_roarm_env.py` into `training/train_ppo.py`, validating observation/action wiring and reward configuration.
- Prepare real-world parameter ranges (friction, latency, mass) for `configs/domain_randomization.yaml`.
