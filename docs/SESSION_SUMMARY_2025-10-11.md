# Session Summary - 2025-10-11

## 1. Objective Context
- Maintain momentum on RoArm M3 sim2real readiness by restoring Isaac Sim's USD (`pxr`) bindings and validating articulation joint access.
- Ensure pre-session automation and documentation stay aligned with environment troubleshooting steps.

## 2. Key Observations Since Previous Session
| Area | Findings |
|------|----------|
| Automation | `scripts/pre_session_check.py` still passes end-to-end; confirms gateway stack is healthy.
| Isaac Sim Environment | `isaacsim[all,extscache]==5.0.0` installed inside `~/isaacsim-venv`. USD payload lives under site-packages extscache; no launcher payload required.
| Launcher Attempts | Headless launcher invoked (`bash ~/isaac-sim.sh --no-window --/app/window/hideUi=1`) but cancelled mid-download; no cached packages present.
| Repository State | USD tooling (`inspect_usd.py`, `view_roarm.py`) ready yet blocked by `pxr`; documentation refreshed up to 2025-10-09 session.
| Risk Review | Main blocker unchanged: missing PhysxSchema/pxr prevents articulation attach and joint enumeration.

## 3. Actions Performed Today
- Re-ran the pre-session checklist to verify local tooling and gateway path.
- Audited repository documentation and scripts to confirm prerequisites are satisfied.
- Re-assessed Isaac Sim asset directories to reconfirm absence of `pxr` and determine that prior launcher run did not complete.
- Prepared structured run plan to monitor launcher progress in real time for the next attempt.

## 4. Blockers & Diagnostics
| Blocker | Evidence | Proposed Diagnostic |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| `pxr` import failure | Resolved. `from pxr import Usd` succeeds after exporting `OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES`, appending the USD libs extension to `PYTHONPATH`, and adding its `bin` + `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. | Persist helper script (`scripts/activate_isaacsim_env.sh`) and document sourcing workflow.
| PhysxSchema application pending | Ready to retry now that USD bindings import cleanly. | Run `scripts/apply_articulation_root.py` inside prepared env and capture results.
| Joint enumeration empty | Previously blocked by missing articulation APIs. | Re-run once articulation root re-applied to confirm expected joint list.

## 5. Immediate Next Actions
1. **Persist pip-based Isaac Sim setup**
   - Retain `~/isaacsim-venv` and wheel caches; ensure `pip list | grep isaacsim` captured in automation notes.
2. **Ship env activation helper**
   - Add `scripts/activate_isaacsim_env.sh` to export `OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA`, `PYTHONPATH`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for USD bindings.
   - Encourage `source scripts/activate_isaacsim_env.sh` before running Isaac Sim tools.
3. **Apply PhysxSchema articulation root** now that USD bindings are live.
4. **Re-run joint tooling** (`inspect_usd.py`, `view_roarm.py`) to confirm articulation visibility.
5. **Document joint ordering vs LeRobot config** once enumeration succeeds.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Launcher download interruption (network/GPU timeout) | Keep terminal session focused; avoid cancelling; ensure adequate disk space.
| Display requirement during bootstrap | Continue using `--no-window`; if windowing dependency arises, wrap in `xvfb-run`.
| Post-bootstrap mismatched USD versions | Utilize bundled Python from Isaac Sim to modify USD to keep dependencies in sync.

## 7. Suggested Enhancements
- Extend `scripts/pre_session_check.py` with optional Isaac Sim health check (pxr import, articulation count) once environment is available.
- Capture successful bootstrap as tarball for quicker reinstalls.
- Draft README section outlining Isaac Sim installation workflow and troubleshooting tips.

## 8. Status Snapshot
| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Automation checks | ✅ Completed and passing |
| Isaac Sim `pxr` availability | ✅ Available via pip install + env exports |
| PhysxSchema Articulation Root | ⏳ Pending |
| Joint enumeration (`view_roarm.py`) | ⏳ Blocked |
| Sim2real mapping doc | ⏳ Pending |

## 9. 실행 결과 업데이트 (2025-10-11)
- `pip install isaacsim[all,extscache]==5.0.0 --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com` 명령으로 5.0.0 전체 패키지를 `~/isaacsim-venv`에 설치 완료.
- `sudo apt install libpython3.11` 추가 설치 후, `OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES` 환경 변수와 USD libs 경로를 `PYTHONPATH`·`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`에 등록하여 `from pxr import Usd` 임포트 성공.
- `isaacsim` 모듈을 통해 USD 경로(`isaacsim/extscache/omni.usd.libs-*`) 확인, 환경 활성화 스크립트 작성 준비.
- 관절 어트리뷰트와 조인트 열거 스크립트는 새로운 환경에서 재실행 예정.
